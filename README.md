### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi. Iâ€™m Alex. I am an anesthesiologist and internist who works at Stanford Medicine. Iâ€™m broadly interested in:

- artificial intelligence in medicine
- design thinking in healthcare
- open-source software
  
I am currently a fellow in the [@stanfordaimlab](https://github.com/stanfordaimlab) where I focus on building tools to improve the user experience of patients and doctors.

My current projects center around evaluation of large language models in clinical settings, such as [evaluating the calculation abilities of ChatGPT](https://github.com/stanfordaimlab/llm-as-clinical-calculator/), testing LLMs knowledge of anesthesia, or [designing of human evaluation solutions.](https://alx.gd/archive).

I am also a per-diem physician at the Palo Alto Veteran's hospital, where I practice hospital medicine. I completed medical school and a masters program  at the UC Berkeley - UCSF Joint Medical Program, followed by the Combined Internal Medicine/Anesthesiology Residency at the Stanford School of Medicine. I am board-certified in internal medicine.
